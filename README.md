# Anastasiya Kuzmich MRes Project: REMASTERING IN PROGRESS

During my Masters in Research in Neuroscience, I explored the use of matrix and tensor decomposition models as data-mining tools for neural correlates of perceptual decision-making in the human brain. Having achieved a first-class grade of 86 and graduating with distinction, I went on to pursue a Data Science qualification at General Assembly. 

I am now remastering this work to a higher standard of data science practices, with an aim to make this project more accessible to biomedical and programming communities alike, as well as hopefully uncovering novel insights with the use of my more recently acquired tools and techniques. -- Anastasiya, 1st August
