EXPLORING MATRIX AND TENSOR DECOMPOSITION MODELS AS DATA-MINING TOOLS FOR NEURAL CORRELATES OF PERCEPTUAL DECISION MAKING IN THE HUMAN BRAIN

###

Perceptual decision making is the process of making a choice based on the available sensory evidence. This study aimed to explore the capabilities of three matrix decomposition models (independent component analysis (ICA), principal component analysis (PCA) and non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF)) and four tensor decomposition models (PARAFAC, Non-Negative Parafac, Tucker and Non-Negative Tucker) at isolating the well-established neural signatures of decision-making neural markers using a single-subject dataset of EEG activity during a face/car categorisation task at various levels of coherence. Machine learning was applied to determine the decoding accuracy scores of the tensor decomposition models. Tensor decompositions were more successful than matrix decomposition methods, and the two-component Non-Negative Tucker was selected as the model which best represented the original features of the data.
